# REQ-O-023: --no-injection-protection Flag

**Tier:** Opt-In | **Priority:** P3

**Addresses:** Severity: Critical / Token Spend: High / Time: High / Context: High

## Description

The framework's external data trust tagging (REQ-F-035) MAY be bypassed for a specific invocation by passing `--no-injection-protection`. This escape hatch is intended for trusted sources (e.g., reading internal configuration authored by the operator). When this flag is passed, external data is not wrapped with trust markers. The flag MUST be logged in the audit trail. The flag MUST require explicit acknowledgment in non-interactive mode.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `--no-injection-protection` causes external data to be returned without `_trusted: false` tagging
- Use of this flag is recorded in the audit log with a warning
- The flag is documented with a security warning in `--help` output

---

## Schema

No dedicated schema type — this requirement disables trust tagging behavior (REQ-F-035) without adding new wire-format fields. When the flag is active, external data fields are returned as plain values rather than wrapped with `_trusted: false` markers.

---

## Wire Format

Without `--no-injection-protection` (default behavior, trust tagging applied):

```bash
$ tool fetch --url https://api.example.com/data
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "content": { "_value": "Hello world", "_trusted": false }
  },
  "error": null,
  "warnings": [],
  "meta": { "duration_ms": 88 }
}
```

With `--no-injection-protection`:

```bash
$ tool fetch --url https://internal.corp/config --no-injection-protection
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "content": "Hello world"
  },
  "error": null,
  "warnings": ["--no-injection-protection was active; external data returned without trust markers"],
  "meta": { "duration_ms": 91, "injection_protection": false }
}
```

---

## Example

The flag is available on all commands once the framework's injection-protection feature is enabled at application startup:

```
app = Framework("tool")
app.enable_injection_protection()

# flag is automatically registered on every command:
# tool fetch --no-injection-protection ...
```
