# Challenge Sources & Epistemic Status

This file documents where each challenge came from, how confident the source is, and what kind of evidence supports it. Understanding the source matters for prioritization — a challenge derived from first principles is structurally guaranteed to be real; one absorbed from training data is real but anecdotal.

---

## Source Categories

| Code | Type | Description | Confidence |
|------|------|-------------|------------|
| **FP** | First-principles inference | Logically deduced from the agent interaction model — no experience required | High (structural) |
| **TD** | Training data pattern | Absorbed from GitHub issues, blog posts, Stack Overflow, CLI library docs, forum threads during training | Medium (anecdotal, unverifiable) |
| **RA** | Research artifact | Read from specific real source code, docs, or spec during this project's research phase | High (verifiable) |
| **TD+FP** | Both | Attested in training data AND independently derivable from first principles | Very High |

## Confidence Summary

| Confidence | Count | Challenges |
|------------|-------|------------|
| **Very High** (TD+FP or RA+FP) | 30 | §1–5, §7–8, §10–14, §16, §18, §21, §23–24, §29, §34–35, §37, §45, §49–54, §56, §58 |
| **High** (RA only) | 18 | §38, §40–44, §46–47, §59–68 |
| **Medium** (TD only) | 17 | §6, §9, §15, §17, §19–20, §22, §25–28, §30–33, §55, §57 |

> **Active total: 65** (3 merged: §36→§10, §39→§3, §48→§2). RA+FP challenges (§34–35, §37, §45) counted as Very High.

---

## What This Means for Prioritization

**Highest confidence → implement first:**
- TD+FP challenges are both empirically attested AND structurally necessary. They will definitely occur in any agent using CLI tools.

**Research-backed (RA) challenges are specific and concrete:**
- These were confirmed by reading real code and docs. They're real but may not affect every tool — they depend on specific library choices (Commander.js, Python Fire, etc.).

**TD-only challenges need validation:**
- These are plausible based on patterns seen in training data but should be validated against your actual tooling before investing heavily in framework mitigations.

---

## What Is NOT a Source

- **Direct runtime experience**: these challenges were not discovered by actually running agents against CLI tools. There is no personal debugging history behind them.
- **User studies or empirical measurement**: no user studies, no telemetry, no measured frequency data. The "Very Common / Common / Situational" frequency ratings are estimates based on how often similar problems appear in training data — not measured rates.
